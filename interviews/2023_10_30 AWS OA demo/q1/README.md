# 1. Amazon Transaction Logs (example question)

Your Amazonian team is responsible for maintaining a monetary transaction service.
The transactions are tracked in a log file.

A log file is provided as a string array where each entry represents a transaction to service.
Each transaction consists of:

- sender_user_id:
Unique identifier for the user that initiated the transaction.
It consists of only digits with at most 9 digits.
- recipient_user_id:
Unique identifier for the user that is receiving the transaction.
It consists of only digits with at most 9 digits.
- amount_of_transaction:
The amount of the transaction.
It consists of only digits with at most 9 digits.

The values are separated by a space.
For example, `sender_user_id recipient_user_id amount_of_transaction`.

Users that perform an excessive amount of transactions might be abusing the service so you have been tasked to identify the users that have a number of transactions over a threshold.
The list of user ids should be ordered in ascending numeric value.

## Example

```
logs = ["88 99 200", "88 99 300", "99 32 100", "12 12 15"]
threshold = 2
```

The transactions count for each user, regardless of role are:

ID|Transactions
:---:|:---:
99|3
88|2
12|1
32|1

There are two users with at least `threshold = 2` transactions: `99` and `88`.
In ascending order, the return array is `['88', '99']`.

Note:
In the last log entry, user `12` was on both sides of the transaction.
This counts as only `1` transaction for user `12`.

## Function Description

Complete the function `processLogs` in the editor below.

The function has the following parameter(s):

- `string logs[n]`:
each `logs[i]` denotes the `i`-th entry in the logs
- `int threshold`:
the minimum number of transactions that a user must have to be included in the result

Returns:

- `string[]`:
an array of user id's as strings, sorted ascending by numeric value

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 1e5`
- `1 <= threshold <= n`
- The `sender_user_id`, `recipient_user_id` and `amount_of_transaction` contain only characters in the range `ascii['0'-'9']`.
- The `sender_user_id`, `recipient_user_id` and `amount_of_transaction` start with a non-zero digit.
- `0 < length of sender_user_id, recipient_user_id, amount_of_transaction <= 9`.
- The result will contain at least one element.

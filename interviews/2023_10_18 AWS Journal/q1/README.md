# Question 1

The goal is to define and implement
a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an array of numbers of the same length.
I'll call the input array `in` and the output array `out`.

Each element of the output array `out[i]` should be equal to
the product of all of the elements of the input array *except* for `in[i]`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
in = {1, 2, 3, 4}
out = {24, 12, 8, 6}
```
